Is it retro-game you’re lookin’ for? LIONOIL [name TBC] is a platform game with a 180 degree twist. Inspired by the classic platform games and [Lionel Richie's Dancing On The Ceiling ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xgT8uwDGLWk)and [TENET](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/577922-tenet).

 

The Game
--------

Lionel Richtea is happy living his best life. It’s party time all the time in the Richtea household. You can dance to the funk, you can even dunk if you want to. 

But wait a second… something isn’t right, Lionel is stuck in a twisty turning time tunnel and the only way out is to keep dancing all night long.
